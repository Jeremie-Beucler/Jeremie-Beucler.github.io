## Welcome!

Hi! I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science at [LaPsyDÉ](https://www.lapsyde.com/home) (CNRS & Université Paris Cité), supervised by [Wim De Neys](https://sites.google.com/site/wimdeneys/), [Zoe Purcell](https://zoepurcell.org/) and [Lucie Charles](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/staff/luciecharles.html). I also collaborate with [Kobe Desender](https://desenderlab.com/kobe-desender/) on the computational side. 

## 

## Research Interests

My research investigates the **cognitive mechanisms underlying human reasoning, with a particular focus on reasoning biases**. I'm especially interested in **how subjective evidence, confidence, and deliberation interact** during the reasoning process. For instance: if someone is strongly biased, how does that affect their sense of confidence when confronted with contradictory evidence? And how does this confidence, in turn, influence the time and effort they're willing to invest in thinking further? 

##

To address these questions, I combine **behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and  large language models**. 

## 

## Outside the Lab

I also work as a freelance cognitive and data scientist. My expertise spans cognitive psychology, behavioral experiments, data science and natural-language processing.
